## Installation
If trying to run the project from your local machine after cloning the code from the github repository, the user must have Node.js installed on their machine. This will give the user access to a number of Node's modules, most importantly 'file system' and 'express'. The user will then need to initiate the server by typing 'npm start' in the command terminal. Then, type 'localhost:3001/' in the browser to view the application.

Otherwise, simply view the deployed application <a href="https://note-taker-mtlankenau.herokuapp.com/">BY CLICKING HERE</a>, using the Heroku cloud application platform.

## Usage
* First, click on the link to the notes page. There, the user will be presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and note's text in the right-hand column. 
* After typing in a note title and note's text, click the Save icon in the navigation at the top of the page. Once clicked, that note will be saved and will appear in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. 
* If the user clicks on a particular saved note in the left-hand column, then the note will appear in the right hand-column. 
* If the user then clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then they're presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column. 
* If the user wishes to delete a particular note, click the Delete icon next to the note. Once clicked, that note will be removed from the left hand column.
